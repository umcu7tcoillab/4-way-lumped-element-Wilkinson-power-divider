**A 4-way Wilkinson power divider made from lumped elements.**

This specific PCB was made for deuterium imaging on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner (45.75MHz), with a maximum input power of about 10kW.
The simulation contains formulas to automaticly calculate the right components for a given frequency. It can also be expanded to facilitate N-number of channels, assuming real world restrictions don't impede this process.
