# A 4-way Wilkinson power divider made from lumped elements

## About us
This design has been made by the coil-lab of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, where we make hardware to support our researchers. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to open up some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.


## The design
This specific PCB was made for deuterium imaging on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner (45.75MHz), with a maximum input power of about 10kW.
The simulation contains formulas to automatically calculate the right components for a given frequency. It can also be expanded to facilitate N-number of channels, assuming real world restrictions don't impede this process.

> Simulation made in Qucsstudio v2.5.7  
> Circuit & PCB made in Target3001 v20
